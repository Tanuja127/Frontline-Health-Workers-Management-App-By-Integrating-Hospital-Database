# Frontline-health-workers-management-app-by-integrating-hospital-database

This code contains the basic design of our idea ,where patient details will be given as input and would be stored in csv file. A unique barcode will be generated for each patient, by scanning which the patient data will be displayed. We also have provision for updating the patient’s data periodically. The other part of the code is to send the notification to the nurses periodically. 

# Hardware 

•	Arduino Uno

•	Mini barcode scan engine

•	Display

•	 TP4056 1A Li-Ion Battery Charging Board Micro USB with Current Protection

•	 Lithium ion battery chargable

# Software
•	 Python 3 

•	 Arduino 2.0

# Process flow

1. The patient data is entered into the main database and gets stored in it as csv file
2. Unique barcode is generated which also gets stored in csv file, which can be printed.
3. The patient data , medications can be updated .
4. Notification for each patient will be triggered by the database .
5. Other timely notification for the nurses will also be received.
6. As the code was getting comlex and the time given to us was not sufficient, the full system code is yet to be done,and also cloud integration is pending.
